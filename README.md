## Azure CI/CD Pipeline for automation build, test and deployment
As you know, Azure Pipelines is a method for automatically builds and tests code projects to make them available to others. It works with just about any language or project type. Azure Pipelines combines continuous integration (CI) and continuous delivery (CD) to test and build your code and ship it to any target. 

The starting point for configuring CI and CD for your applications is to have your source code in a version control system. Azure DevOps supports two forms of version control - GitHub andÂ Azure Repos. Any changes you push to your version control repository will be automatically built and validated.


## Requirement
To use Azure Pipelines, you need:
- An organization in Azure DevOps.
- Source code stored in a version control system like GitHub
- YAML editor
